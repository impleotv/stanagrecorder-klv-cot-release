This application has been discontinued. Although the application may continue to function, we will no longer be providing any further development, bug fixes, or updates to this product. As a result, we can only offer very limited support for any issues or inquiries that you may have. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, you may continue using the application if it still works for you. Thank you for your understanding.


## Installation

> Note: Microsoft has removed some servers, so the required dependencies are not downloaded automatically anymore. You may need to download and install them manually

### Prerequisites 
VC++ runtime (2010 and 2013, 32 bit) must be present on your PC (so the application could be installed and run properly). You have to download 2 small files from MS servers as you most likely don't have them installed.

## License

No license is needed for application evaluation - it will work in demo mode (with some restrictions). 

**STANAG Recorder KLV/COT** is a node-locked software, so you have to get a license (**after purchasing the SW**) in order to lift demo restrictions. Please install the application and fill out an [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_XW6bDsFce1G1cpds4gMQNlwNax0CvkWzcMbscxZ5rLaIbA/viewform), providing the ***Node Info*** string (IMPORTANT!!!) for the target machine.  
***Node Info*** string can be found at ***Options->License***.

Please copy-paste *Node Info*, don't send an image...
